    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This <strong>Buffalo Chicken Chili</strong> is the best of two game day classics: buffalo chicken wings and chili! Top your bowl with sour cream, tortilla chips, chopped green onions, cheese, and extra buffalo sauce for a new Super Bowl favorite.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>  
      <ul>
          <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (1 1/2 pounds)</li>
          <li>2 14.5-ounce cans diced fire-roasted tomatoes</li>
          <li>1 7-ounce can diced fire-roasted green chiles</li>
          <li>1 cup unsalted or low-sodium chicken stock</li>
          <li>3/4 cup buffalo wing sauce, plus more for serving</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
          <li>2 15.5-ounce cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed</li>
          <li>Salt and ground black pepper</li>
          <li>Sour cream, crumbled blue cheese, diced green onion, and tortilla chips, for serving</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><h4>Cook the soup:</h4>
            <p>Add the chicken, tomatoes, chiles, chicken stock, buffalo wing sauce, chili powder, and cumin to a large pot or Dutch oven. Bring to a boil; reduce to a gentle simmer over medium heat, and cook until the chicken is cooked all the way through, about 25 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Shred the chicken and add the beans:</h4>
            <p>Remove the chicken breasts from the pot and shred with two forks. Return the shredded chicken along with the beans to the pot, and cook until the beans are warmed through, about 5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Season and serve:</h4>
        <p>Taste the chili and season with salt, pepper, and more buffalo wing sauce as desired. (Note: buffalo wing sauce tends to be high in sodium, so you might not need to add very much, if any, additional salt.)</p>
        <p>Ladle the chili into bowls and serve topped with sour cream, crumbled blue cheese, diced green onion, tortilla chips, or whatever other ingredients you enjoy.</p></li>
      </ol>
