    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This <strong> Lemon butter baked tilapia</strong> is ready in 20 minutes! Make this easy weeknight meal with tilapia, or your favorite flaky white fish.</p>
      <p>Simple baked fish gets none of the glory, but always gets a thumbs-up from those who are otherwise wary of seafood.</p>
      <p>It’s quick and easy; my mother would make it when I was growing up for that very reason. Now that I’m a parent, I like knowing I can count on my daughter asking for seconds of this dish.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds tilapia fillets</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt </li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><h4>Preheat the oven and position rack:</h4>
        <p>Position a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 450°F.</p>
        <li><h4>Pat fish dry and season:</h4>
        <p>Pat the fish dry using a paper towel. In a large baking dish, arrange the fillets in a single layer, making sure they do not overlap. Season the fillets with salt and pepper. Set aside.</p></li>  
        <li><h4>Make the butter sauce:</h4>
        <p>In a small skillet over medium heat add the butter. Once the butter has melted add the garlic and cook until aromatic, about 2 minutes. Add the lemon juice and remove from the heat. Pour the sauce over the fish, trying to get the garlic bits on top of the fillets rather than the pan.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Bake the fish</h4></li>
        <p>Bake the fish, until it is opaque and easily flakes apart when gently prodded, about 10 minutes. Serve immediately, spooning the sauce over the fish.</p></li>
      </ol>
